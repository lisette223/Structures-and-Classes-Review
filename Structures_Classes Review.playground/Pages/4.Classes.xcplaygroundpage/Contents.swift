//: Exercise: BankAccount Class
/*:
1. Create a BankAccount class with the following properties:

* accountNumber (String)
* accountHolder (String)
* balance (Double)
*/







/*:2. Implement an initializer to set the initial values for accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance.
*/
/*: 3. Add a method named `deposit` that takes an amount (Double) as a parameter and adds it to the account balance.
 */
/*: 4. Add a method named `withdraw` that takes an amount (Double) as a parameter and subtracts it from the account balance.
   Ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the account balance.
*/
/*: 5. Implement a property observer for the balance property. Whenever the balance changes, print a message indicating the new balance.
*/
/*: 6. Create an instance of the BankAccount class and perform the following operations:
* Set an initial balance.
* Deposit an amount.
* Withdraw an amount.
* Display the account information after each operation.
*/
/*: 7. Experiment with different deposit and withdrawal amounts to observe the property observer in action.
*/

/*: 8. Add a computed property named `formattedBalance` that returns the balance formatted as a currency string.
*/




/*: INHERITANCE

1. Create a SavingsAccount class that inherits from the BankAccount class.*/
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
/*: 2. Add a new property named `interestRate` (Double) to the SavingsAccount class.*/
/*: 3. Implement an initializer for the SavingsAccount class that takes parameters for accountNumber, accountHolder, initialBalance, and interestRate.*/
/*: 4. Override the displayInfo method to include information about the interest rate.*/
/*: 5. Implement a method named `addInterest` that calculates and adds interest to the account based on the interestRate.
*/
/*: 6. Create an instance of the SavingsAccount class and perform the following operations:
 * Set an initial balance and interest rate.
 * Deposit an amount.
 * Add interest.
 * Display the account information after each operation.
*/

/*:7. Experiment with different deposit amounts and observe the interest calculations.*/
